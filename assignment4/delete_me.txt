The problem arises when two processes initiate multiple transactions to multiple servers. The messages may arrive out of order, as Figure (^^ update_me**) suggests. If transactions of both clients are dependent on each other, their out-of-order execution leads to inconsistent commits. Here, conservative two phase locking is better solution. The first server to receive the transaction request will lock all resaurces needed for this transaction, thus ensuring consistent commit for both transactions.
